# ECFChecker

This project contains an implementation of a dynamic monitor of the ECF property of Ethereum transactions.
It is based on [link](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum "_geth_"), the Go implementation of an Ethereum client, version 1.5.9.

## Use cases
 - Online verification of the ECF property for new transactions as fetched by the client.
 - In the POPL'18 paper the tool was used to check all transactions since Ethereum's inception until June 23rd 2017.
